# intro
To emphasis security an organization should apply multiple security controls (support company policies, guide behaviors, ensure that operations stay secure and compliant) , respond to incidents, maintain a safe and efficient environment.
# Control categories
Main control categories:
- Managerial
- Operational
- technical
- physical
each addresses a specific area within an organization to ensure security, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.
### Managerial Controls
This category focuses on reducing risk by ensuring that daily activities align with the organization overall goals and values by setting up policies, procedures and standards that helps direct the the actions of individuals and team.

this create an environment where risk are managed and anticipated in advance.

examples:
- Performance review: These are regular evaluations of how well employees are doing their jobs
- Risk assessments: his involves systematically identifying and evaluating potential risks that could impact operations
- Code of Conduct: A code of conduct outlines the values and behavior expected from employees

In short, managerial controls set the tone for how people work, make decisions, and contribute to a secure and responsible workplace environment.
### Operational Controls
The goal of operational controls is to make sure that daily tasks are carried out according to best practices, company policies, and security standards. When well executed, these controls reduce risk, increase productivity, and support overall business objectives.

examples:
- Incident response procedure: These are step-by-step guidelines that outline how to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents
- Security awareness Training: Train employees recognize and respond to common security threats
- User access Management: controlling who has access to which systems, applications, and data
### Technical controls
The main goal of technical controls is to maintain the integrity of systems and data by implementing security measures to the organization systems to prevent breaches, suspicious activity etc.

examples:
- Firewalls
- data encryption

**Reminder:** Technical controls mitigate risk and are implemented by the security team.
### Physical controls
Designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to the organization

examples:
- bio metric locks
- access control vestibule
- security guards
- security fences
- cameras
- man-traps
## Note
Physical control is the first barrier against threats and should be implemented, since "soft" control depend first on physical control and security.
# Control Types
### Preventive Controls
stop threats before they happen to reduce the chances of a security incident or failure by addressing risks in advance.

examples:
- installing firewalls
- Providing security awareness training to prevent human error
- Using access control lists (ACLs) to limit who can access certain resources
- Quality checks in manufacturing to catch defects early
### Detective Controls
meant to identify problems after they occur. They don’t stop threats, but they help spot them quickly so you can respond.

examples:
- Log monitoring using SIEM systems to detect suspicious activity
- Security cameras recording footage to review after an incident
- Audit logs that reveal unusual user behavior or access
### Corrective controls
Once an issue is detected, corrective controls step in to fix the problem and return things to normal.

examples:
- Restoring data from a backup after a ransomware attack
- Installing a security patch to fix a known vulnerability
- Resetting passwords after a phishing incident
### Deterrent Controls
discourage unwanted behavior by making the consequences or risks clear.

Examples:
- Surveillance cameras in visible areas to discourage theft or misconduct
- Warning signs that indicate alarm systems or monitoring
- Strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that signal systems are protected
### Compensating Controls
Sometimes, the ideal control isn’t possible — due to technical limitations, cost, or other factors. In these cases, compensating controls offer alternative protections to reduce risk.

Examples:
- Requiring extra approvals for large transactions when automation isn’t available
- Using a secondary verification method if MFA fails
- Increasing physical security (like guards) when digital access controls are weak
### Directive Controls
Directive controls provide clear instructions or guidance to help people follow rules, perform tasks correctly, and meet compliance requirements.

Examples:
- A code of conduct that defines acceptable behavior
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for technical tasks
- Regulatory policies that outline what companies must report or document
