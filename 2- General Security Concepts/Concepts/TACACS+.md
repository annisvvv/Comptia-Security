| Authentication   | The network device forwards user credentials over an encrypted connection to the TACACS+ server for verification. | To verify the user's identity before granting access to a network device.    | The server checks credentials against a local database, Active Directory, LDAP, or RADIUS.          | Centralizes login management and secures credentials using an encrypted connection.      |
| Authorization    | The device checks with the TACACS+ server to determine if a specific command entered by the user is permitted.    | To manage and restrict the privileges and commands a user can execute.       | The network device communicates with the TACACS+ server in the background for each command session. | Enforces granular control over user actions and prevents unauthorized command execution. |
| Accounting       | The protocol logs the entire session, including every command entered by the user.                                | To maintain a record of all user activities on network devices for auditing. | Logs can be forwarded to external systems such as syslog, IDS, and SIEM.                            | Provides a full audit trail of network changes and user behavior for forensic analysis.  |
