Cisco Systems 802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based network access control (authentication/authorization), acting as a security gatekeeper that verifies a device's identity before granting network access, preventing unauthorized users from connecting to wired or wireless networks. It works by blocking traffic until a client (supplicant) authenticates with an authenticator (switch/AP) via a central server (RADIUS), opening a virtual port for approved devices to pass data.

The Process
1. **Request:** A device connects and the authenticator blocks all traffic except for authentication messages (EAPOL).
2. **Authentication:** The supplicant sends its credentials (username/password, certificate) through the authenticator to the authentication server.
3. **Decision:** The server verifies the credentials, often against a directory (like Active Directory), and sends back an "accept" or "reject".
4. **Access Granted/Denied:** If accepted, the authenticator opens the port for normal traffic; if rejected, the port remains blocked.

when a computer for example try to connect to a switch that have authentication the switch will talk the the supplicant (software in the computer) using the 802.1x, the computer prompt the user for username and password (or may be preconfigured for the device)send it to the switch (authenticator) the switch will then supply these info to a authentication server ISE identity service engine for example using the RADIUS protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2865) also refereed as AAA server.

when the server find that the password and username checks out it resend a message using the RADIUS protocol to the switch granting access to the device, the server could also push rules for this device depending on the configuration (which switch to connect to ect)

imagine if the device that wanna connect doesnt have the supplicant software it could not talk to the switch, so if the switch get no response it will check the layer 2 address (mac address) and do authentication based on mac address 
## **Why 802.1X Uses RADIUS**
802.1X itself is just a framework that controls access to a network port (e.g., on a switch or WLAN). It needs an **authentication server** to validate credentials. RADIUS is the standard protocol used between the **network access device** (switch/WLAN controller) and the **authentication server**.

When a device tries to connect:
1. The **supplicant** (client) sends credentials.
2. The **authenticator** (switch/WLAN AP) passes those credentials to a **RADIUS server**.    
3. The **RADIUS server** verifies them and sends an Accept/Reject decision back.

This RADIUS interaction is a core part of how 802.1X works — it’s essentially built around it.
