Since cryptography is used widely nowadays by applications, networks etc, and plays a important role in the security of today digital life, in basically any type of data transfer, storage etc there is a cryptographic layer designed to mitigate risks, whether through encryption to protect privacy, hashing to ensure integrity, or digital signatures to verify identity.

# Lab resolution
Since task 1 is just an introduction i will begin from task 2 of the Lab.
## Task 2 : Types of cryptography
Since sending messages (packets) over the internet in plain text is **insecure** if the network is monitored, a mechanism like **encryption** comes into place. Encryption is divided into two type:
- **Symmetric**
- **Asymmetric**

lets take a look at the specification of each:

|                 | Symmetric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Asymmetric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **definition**  | In Symmetric encryption the same encryption key is used for encryption and decryption. This poses a major security problem that is **key distribution**, in order for the two parties to get the same key one has to send his key t the other. | in Asymmetric encryption two separate key are used for encryption and decryption one called **public key** and the other **private key** respectively, this way the public keys can get shared across network without any problem.                     |
| **Security**    | Symmetric encryption are not that secure since keys had to be shared over networks exposing it to potential threat.                                                                                                                            | Asymmetric encryption are more secure due to the fact that the private key never needs to be shared or transmitted over the network **it remains exclusively on the owner's machine**. However the public key can be shared but only can encrypt data. |
| **Performance** | symmetric encryption is generally preferred for large data transfers because it is significantly **faster** and requires less computational overhead. symmetric algorithms use fast, low-level operations.                                     | asymmetric encryption is significantly **slower** and more computationally intensive because it relies on complex mathematical problems.                                                                                                               |
#### Questions answers :

1. What type of cryptography is more secure?
	Asymmetric encryption is more secure since it doesn't share the private key responsible for decryption and effectively solves the 'key distribution problem.' Since the private key remains exclusively on the owner's machine and is never transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of an attacker intercepting it during transit.

2. What type of cryptography is faster?
	Symmetric cryptography is faster because it require less computational overhead due to it light algorithm.

3. What type of cryptography will a Bank site use?
	Asymmetric cryptography will be used in banks site since they need security more than anything.

4. What will you use to encrypt your messages in asymmetric cryptography?
	 In Asymmetric cryptography the public key is used to encrypt messages.

5. What will you use to decrypt messages in asymmetric cryptography?
	In Asymmetric cryptography the private key is used to decrypt messages.

6. Does symmetric cryptography use two different keys for encryption/decryption? (aye/nay)
	nay symmetric use the same key for encryption and decryption.
## Task 3 : What is a hash?
A hash is a long string of characters generated by special hashing algorithms like `MD5`, what makes it special is that hashes are irreversible.

The primary function of a cryptographic hash is to protect sensitive data like passwords. Because hashing is a **one-way function**, even if a database is stolen, it is computationally impossible to reverse the hash to retrieve the original password. To authenticate, the system hashes the password provided by the user and compares it to the stored hash if they match, access is granted.

other use cases include checking the integrity of files and messages. By comparing the hash of a file before and after it is sent, you can ensure that the data has not been modified, corrupted, or tampered by an attacker.
#### Questions answers :
1. What's the `MD5` hash of "hashes are cool"?
	Plenty of tools exists to hash like [CypherChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) that propose multiple hashing algorithm to use but since I am on a Linux system i can just run these commands in the terminal : 
```
anis@ThinkPad-X13:~$ md5sum
hashes are cool # press ctrl+D whitout typing enter
f762d32e3c160900d94b683e927555b9  - # this is our hash
```

2. What does `MD5` stand for?
	`MD5` stands for ***Message-Digest 5***

3. Who created `MD5`?
	`MD5` was created by cryptographer ***`Ronald Rivest`*** in 1991
# Task 4 : Decoding/encoding
there is a difference between encoding and encrypting, encrypting is done using a key and is meant to be visible to anyone in possession of the key. However encoding is a way to represent data.
#### Questions answers :

1. Encode the string `"cryptographyisuseful"` with `Base64`
	Online tools like [CypherChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) can be used, in my case i will use my Terminal using the command `echo -n "string to encode" | base64`
```
anis@ThinkPad-X13:~$ echo -n "cryptographyisuseful" | base64
Y3J5cHRvZ3JhcGh5aXN1c2VmdWw=
```

1. Decode the string `"dGhlIHNlY3JldCB3b3JkIGlzIDogd2F0ZXJtZWxvbg=="`. What's the secret word?
	same as encoding however i will use the `-d` switch that stands for decode `echo -n "base 64 encoded" | base64 -d`
```
anis@ThinkPad-X13:~$ echo -n "dGhlIHNlY3JldCB3b3JkIGlzIDogd2F0ZXJtZWxvbg==" | base64 -d
the secret word is : watermelon
```

# Takeaway
### 1.Encryption
encryption is divided into two:

| **Feature**       | **Symmetric**                                         | **Asymmetric**                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Key Count**     | One (Shared)                                          | Two (Public & Private)           |
| **Speed**         | Fast (Low overhead)                                   | Slow (Complex math)              |
| **Con**           | **Key Distribution:** How do you send the key safely? | **Complexity:** High CPU usage.  |
| **Best Use Case** | Bulk data (Hard drives, file transfers).              | Initial handshakes (HTTPS, SSH). |
### 2. Hashing

Hashing is a **one-way**. Unlike encryption, you aren't meant to "decrypt" a hash.
- **Purpose:** Integrity (Checking if a file changed) and Password Security.
- **Key Concept:** Even a tiny change in the input (like adding a space) creates a completely different hash—this is known as the **Avalanche Effect**.
### 3. Encoding vs. Encryption

This is a common point of confusion.
- **Encryption:** Protects the **secrecy** of data (requires a key).
- **Encoding:** Protects the **usability** of data.
- **Use Case:** `Base64` is used to send binary data (like images) over protocols designed for text (like HTML/Email).
